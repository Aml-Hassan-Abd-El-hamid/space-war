Hello from Egypt , 20-12-2020

This is my CS50X final project which is a game named "space war" which was implemented using lua and love2d, that game require 2 or 3 players  to be played, and the winner is the player who gets the biggest score.

I used three libraries in this game to help me do the next:

"class" : that one was used in the course to help us in building classes & objects in love2d & lua so I reused.
"suit-master" : that one was used to hellp me with building the menues to get the no.of players and time from the user.
"cron" : that one was not really necessary  but I liked to use as it made building a timer more easier in love2d.

My project consist of three main files : main.lua, intro.lua, player.lua
